:mailbox: A simple mail system developed with Django, Docker, Celery and Redis

Here is an example of an email confirmation system created to assist in the tutorial I created that you can find at: [https://medium.com/@mdcg.dev/configurando-um-sistem-em-django-para-executar-tarefas-ass%C3%ADncronas-utilizando-celery-redis-e-53a30d0d2ec2](https://medium.com/@mdcg.dev/configurando-um-sistem-em-django-para-executar-tarefas-ass%C3%ADncronas-utilizando-celery-redis-e-53a30d0d2ec2)

## Django

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

**Documentation:** [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/)

## Docker

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

**Documentation:** [https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/)

## Celery

Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing.	It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well.

The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on a single or more worker servers using multiprocessing, Eventlet,	or gevent. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background) or synchronously (wait until ready).

**Documentation:** [http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/index.html](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/index.html)

## Redis

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
